## üöÄ Overview

**sdspeed** is a lightweight macOS utility that helps you quickly and accurately measure the read and write performance of SD cards, USB flash drives, SSDs, and other storage devices. Whether you are testing memory cards for photography, validating the speed of an external SSD, or checking USB drives for reliability, sdspeed delivers precise benchmarks in just a few clicks.  

The app provides clear performance metrics, including sequential read/write speeds and stability analysis over time. With its minimal interface and easy-to-understand results, even non-technical users can test storage devices and ensure they meet performance expectations.  

For professionals, sdspeed is a valuable tool to evaluate if SD cards are fast enough for 4K/8K video recording, or if external drives are reliable for backups and media editing. By simulating real-world data transfers, it ensures that you don‚Äôt just see theoretical numbers but actual usable speed results.  

sdspeed is built natively for macOS, offering speed, stability, and a clean interface that integrates seamlessly into your workflow.
